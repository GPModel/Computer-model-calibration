Requirements: 
Matlab R2020b, Matlab Global Optimization Toolbox, Matlab Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, and EnergyPlus 9.4.0;


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Steps for replicating results for Example 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Step 1: Install EnergyPlus 9.4.0 in the folder C:\EnergyPlusV9-4-0

Step 2: Put all the Matlab codes, the EPBasicFile.idf file, and the EPWeather.epw file in a single folder.

Step 3: Run MainExample1.m


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Step for replicating results for Example 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Step: Run MainExample2.m to obtain the results for Example 2


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Descriptions of files %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
