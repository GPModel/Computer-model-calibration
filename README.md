# Computer-model-calibration

Requirements: 
Matlab R2020b, Matlab Global Optimization Toolbox, Matlab Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, and EnergyPlus 9.4.0;

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Step for replicating results for Example 1%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Step: Run MainExample1.m to replicates the simulations and shows results for Example 1

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Steps for replicating results for EnergyPlus Example %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Step 1: Install the EnergyPlus 9.4.0  on the folder C:\EnergyPlusV9-4-0

Step 2: Move the current folder to a new folder, and the address of the new folder can not contain space ' ', i.e., the address of the new folder should be <C:\Users\ABC\Desktop\MatlabCodes_ModifiedSl>

Step 3: Run MainExample2.m
